# Behavioural Driven Development (BDD)

## Introduction

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development approach that focuses on collaboration and communication among stakeholders to define and deliver software that meets the desired behavior and outcomes. BDD aims to bridge the gap between business stakeholders, developers, and testers by using a shared understanding of the system's behavior in the form of executable specifications.

## Concepts

Here are key aspects of Behavior-Driven Development:

### Shared Language

BDD promotes the use of a shared language, known as the ubiquitous language, which is understood by all stakeholders, including business experts, developers, and testers. This language helps in clarifying requirements and expectations, ensuring consistent understanding and communication across the team.

### User Stories and Scenarios

BDD uses user stories as a format to capture high-level requirements from the user's perspective. User stories are typically written in a specific format, such as "As a [user role], I want [action] so that [benefit]." Scenarios, written using the Given-When-Then (Gherkin) syntax, are used to describe concrete examples of how the system should behave in response to user actions.

### Executable Specifications

BDD encourages the creation of executable specifications that can be automated and serve as living documentation. These specifications, often written in Gherkin syntax, describe the expected behavior of the system in a structured and readable format. They act as acceptance criteria and serve as a basis for development and testing.

### Collaboration and Communication

BDD emphasizes collaboration and communication among stakeholders throughout the development process. Business experts, developers, and testers work together to define, refine, and validate the behavior of the system. This collaboration helps ensure that everyone shares a common understanding of the requirements and that the software meets the desired behavior.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Integration

BDD aligns with the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) by encouraging writing tests before implementing the corresponding functionality. BDD scenarios serve as the basis for creating automated tests that validate the behavior of the system. This approach helps drive the development process and ensures that the code meets the specified requirements.

### Feedback and Iteration

BDD promotes an iterative approach to development, where feedback from stakeholders is continuously incorporated into the development process. As scenarios and specifications are reviewed and validated, they can be refined and updated to reflect the evolving understanding of the desired behavior. This iterative feedback loop helps to address misunderstandings, correct course, and deliver software that aligns with stakeholder expectations.

## Conclusion

By focusing on behavior and using executable specifications, BDD enables a shared understanding of requirements and promotes collaboration between stakeholders. It helps ensure that the software system meets the desired behavior, aligns with business goals, and provides value to end-users. BDD enhances communication, reduces ambiguity, and supports an iterative development approach driven by clear specifications and automated tests.

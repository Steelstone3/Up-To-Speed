# Stand Up

## Introduction

Stand up is a daily ceremony conducted by the team to provide an update, as individuals, on the current progress of a task.

## Process

Stand up is split into three parts

> What I did yesterday
>
> What I plan to do today
>
> Any blockers I may or are currently facing

Stand ups as a meeting should aim to be breif. Aim to be prepared with the three statements prior to the meeting. Jotting this down quickly on a text editor will often suffice.

### What I did yesterday

For "what I did yesterday" give a breif overview of yesterday's events. It is important to keep to "the what" rather than "the how" or "the why" see examples

On Mondays aim to prepare to say what you did on Friday ready before the stand up.

### What I did yesterday Example

"Yesterday I fixed a bug around the graph displaying incorrect results when you enter in -1 into the depth input"

### What I plan to do today

Similar to the previous for "what I plan to do today" give a breif overview of the work that you plan to do today again focusing on "the what".

### What I plan to do today Example

"Today I plan to start a feature around the adding saving to the database functionality to the flight parameters"

### Any blockers

In this section declare any current blockers that you currently know of preventing you achieving your current task.

This can result in a quick discussion. If the dicussion extends past 1 minute take it to a meeting after the stand up.

Generally blockers can be raised to make the team aware of things that are slowing progress down and manage expectations. They can also be used as a request for assistance.

### Any blockers Example

"I don't have any blockers currently"

"I am blocked with merge conflicts for yesterday's work going into trunk"

"I am blocked as my database has corrupted which is preventing me from progressing with the flight parameters save to the database functionality"

## Bad Examples

The main issues with "Bad Examples" are too much or too little information being given in each segment of the stand up. It is a "fine art" to get the delivery just right and takes some self reflection/ feedback.

Here are a number of bad examples that you should try and avoid when giving your stand up update. Try to avoid these common mistakes.

## Putting it all together

Use this as a template when writing your quick script in your text editor for a stand up

"Yesterday I fixed a bug that is in PR around the graph displaying incorrect results when you enter in -1 into the depth input"

"Today I plan to start a feature around saving to the database in the flight parameters"

"I am blocked as my database has been corrupted which is preventing me from progressing with the flight parameters save functionality. I also have merge conflicts on my PR with yesterday's bug fix."

This example is clear, to the point and provides enough context to the situation this developer faces with their work.

### "The How" Bad Example

"Yesterday I fixed a bug around the graph displaying incorrect results when you enter in -1 into the depth input. To do this I went into the depth view model and made it so that it validates against inputs of -1. I sent a PR to John...(blah blah) Did you get that PR by the way John?"

### "The Why" Bad Example

"Today I plan to fix some technical debt...(blah blah) this is important because less technical debt means that we will be able to have good development velocity in (this area) in the future... (blah blah)"

### Too Vague Bad Example

"Today I plan to fix a bug with the graph"

### Too Susinct Bad Example

"Yesterday I fixed a bug, today I plan to fix more bugs and I don't have any blockers"

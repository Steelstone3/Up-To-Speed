## The Problems With Test Coverage

To focus on test coverage moves away from the point of doing test driven development. It emphasises coverage at the cost of what makes sense to cover and what is performant to cover. In other words writing a test for the sakes of writing a test to meet some arbitrary code coverage percentage target.

This way of thinking often leads to poorly written tests that add little value to a project or a layer of testing that isn't required by the project.

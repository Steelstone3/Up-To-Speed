# Introduction

Coupling is the concept used to describe the degree to which different modules, components or classes in a software system depend on each other.

## Loose Coupling

Loose coupling refers to a situation where the components are independent of one another.

Generally this is the approach that is taken for OOP.

## Tight Coupling

Tight coupling refers to a situation where the components in a software system are strongly dependent on one another.

## Significance

Coupling is situational in development and it often depends on the design. The way to think about this is through aggregates and components. This approach will lead to better design.

## Application

Applying the correct type of coupling is an important part of software design and there is no hard or fast rule just good judgement from expierence. TDD lends itself to helping decide upon which approach is best to take.

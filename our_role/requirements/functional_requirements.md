# Functional Requirements

## Introduction

A functional requirement is a specification that describes what a system, software application, or product must do in order to fulfill a specific business or user need. It outlines the features, capabilities, and functionalities that a system must provide to meet the requirements of the user or the business.

Functional requirements are typically written in a clear and concise language, and are often accompanied by use cases, diagrams, and other supporting documentation.

## Cucumber Syntax

Cucumber syntax is a set of keywords and conventions used to write executable specifications for software applications. It is based on the Gherkin language, which provides a simple, human-readable syntax for describing the behavior of the system in terms of concrete examples or scenarios.

The basic syntax of Cucumber/Gherkin consists of the following elements:

> - Feature: A high-level description of the functionality being tested.
Scenario: A specific example or use case that illustrates the behavior of the system.
>
> - Given/When/Then: Keywords used to describe the different steps of the scenario. "Given" is used to describe the initial state of the system, "When" is used to describe an action that changes the state of the system, and "Then" is used to describe the expected outcome of the action.
>
> - And/But: Keywords used to add additional steps or to specify exceptions to the previous step.
>
> - Cucumber syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, even for non-technical stakeholders. It allows developers to create executable tests that can be run automatically to verify that the software meets the requirements specified in the scenarios.

Cucumber syntax can be used with a wide range of programming languages and testing frameworks, making it a flexible and powerful tool for software testing and quality assurance.

### Example

```cucumber
Feature: Login Functionality

  Scenario: User logs in with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid username and password
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should be redirected to the home page
    And see a welcome message

  Scenario: User logs in with invalid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters invalid username and password
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see an error message
    And remain on the login page
```

In this example, the functional requirement is to ensure that the login functionality of a system works correctly. The two scenarios listed describe different ways that a user can attempt to log in, and the expected behavior of the system in each case.

The Cucumber syntax used in this example is designed to be easily understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders, and allows the requirements to be written in a clear, concise, and easily testable manner. By using this syntax, developers can create automated tests that verify that the software meets the functional requirements as specified.

# Develop With Confidence Using Git

## Developers Are *Indecisive*

As a developer how many times have you come across a situation of uncertainty with which direction to take a feature on a codebase.

I myself can name numerous examples.

Sometimes this indecision can be thought through and a solution reached.

Maybe the blocker came from unclear direction or requirements that can be discussed.

However sometimes the situation of indecision comes from a technical implementation.

I would make the case that git eliminates the technical indecision.

## Code Without *Indecision*

How can we then code without indecision as it pertains to git?

Git is a form of version control. I like to conceptualise version control as a checkpoint system in video games.

If we think to that for a moment.

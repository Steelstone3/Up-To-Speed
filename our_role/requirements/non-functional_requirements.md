# Non-Functional Requirements

## Introduction

Non-functional requirements are the quality attributes or constraints that define how a software system should behave and operate, rather than what it should do. These requirements describe the characteristics of the system that are not related to its specific functionality, but rather to its overall performance, usability, security, reliability, and other similar aspects.

## Types

Some common types of non-functional requirements include:

> - Performance: Describing the speed, scalability, and capacity of the system, and how it handles various types of loads or stress.
>
> - Usability: Describing how easy and intuitive the system is to use, and how well it meets the needs and expectations of its users.
>
> - Security: Describing how well the system protects against unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security threats.
>
> - Reliability: Describing how dependable and consistent the system is, and how well it handles errors, crashes, or other failures.
>
> - Compatibility: Describing how well the system integrates with other software or platforms, and how well it supports different devices or operating systems.

## Summary

Non-functional requirements are often as important as functional requirements, as they can have a significant impact on the overall user experience, performance, and success of the system. They can be challenging to define and test, as they are often subjective or difficult to quantify, but they are essential for ensuring that the system meets the desired level of quality and performance.

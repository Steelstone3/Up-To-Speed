# Kanban

## Introduction

Kanban is an agile project management methodology that focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress (WIP), and optimizing workflow efficiency. It originated from the Toyota Production System and was later applied to software development and other knowledge work domains. Kanban provides a visual representation of work items and helps teams manage and improve their delivery process.

## Concepts

Here are the key elements of Kanban:

### Kanban Board

The Kanban board is a visual representation of the workflow. It typically consists of columns that represent different stages of work, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Each work item is represented by a card or sticky note that moves across the board as it progresses through the workflow.

### Work Items

Work items in Kanban represent tasks, user stories, or any unit of work that needs to be completed. They are visualized as cards on the Kanban board and typically include relevant information such as a description, assignee, and due date.

### WIP Limits

Kanban places a strong emphasis on limiting work in progress (WIP) to improve flow and reduce bottlenecks. WIP limits are set for each column on the Kanban board, indicating the maximum number of items that can be in progress at any given time. By limiting WIP, teams can focus on completing work before starting new tasks, thereby reducing multitasking and improving overall efficiency.

### Pull System

Kanban operates on a "pull" system, where work is pulled into the next stage of the workflow only when capacity becomes available. As a work item is completed, the team pulls the next item from the previous column into the next column. This ensures a smooth flow of work and helps prevent overloading team members.

### Continuous Improvement

Kanban encourages continuous improvement through regular analysis and optimization of the workflow. Teams regularly review their Kanban board and identify areas for improvement. These improvements can include streamlining processes, adjusting WIP limits, identifying and resolving bottlenecks, and optimizing the overall flow of work.

### Metrics and Analytics

Kanban promotes the use of metrics to measure and monitor team performance. Common metrics in Kanban include lead time (the time it takes for an item to move from start to finish), cycle time (the time it takes to complete one item), and throughput (the number of items completed within a given time frame). These metrics provide insights into team efficiency, bottlenecks, and opportunities for improvement.

## Conclusion

Kanban offers a flexible and visual approach to project management, allowing teams to track and manage their work effectively. It promotes transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement, enabling teams to deliver high-quality work with improved efficiency.

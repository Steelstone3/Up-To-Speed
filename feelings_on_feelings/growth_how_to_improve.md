# Growth How To Improve

## Introduction

Just a short one but I think this is an important one. Failure really genuinely is a part of life and completely fine.

## Your Average

Hate to break it to you but you are average. It sounds worse than it actually is so give me a chance to explain myself.

Take a talent/ hobby or skill you have and start to digest where you would place if you were to compare yourself to everyone else that also has that talent, hobby or skill in an average-ness bell curve graph.

For myself I will take my guitar playing. I started in 2004. YouTube wasn't out at this time and guitar content on YouTube was even further out. The hardest song I can play well is Periphery Prayer Position and the hardest solo I can play well is Pantera Domination.

> The songs I have named are hard and require a lot practise, technique and patience to master

On the average-ness bell curve taking all guitar players I sit about upper-average. The music that inspires me from the 90s to the 10s is more technically challenging than the music from the 70s so that pushes me to be a more technical player (mastery by imitation). On the other hand I was too early to the train to have YouTube as my teacher which has a wider array of knowledge and expertise than what a single guitar teacher can provide.

There are some other considerations within this bell curve I have ignored in my personal ranking. 90% of people who take up an instrument quit within a year and 50% within 2 years. I have been playing for 20 years (2004) which will put me into a rare minority of players. Rarer still is the age I started. I have played in 3 different bands. I have music that I am writing right now.

When you consider all of these other factor that could be consider outliers where you sit on the average-ness curve looks better than it might have done at first.

> On average just being dedicated and sticking at something can find yourself landing around the top 10% with diminishing returns past that point

Being average is a super power and I will speak more to this later in this blog.

## Growth

### Thousand Hours Rule

The thousand hours rule to get good at something is a myth. This gets extrapolated to ten-thousand hours to be the best which exacerbates the myth and leads to people burning out when they don't see the results they want to see as they try to improve.

> 1,000 hours is 41 days
>
> 10,000 hours is 416 days

I like to think of the myth of the 10,000 hours rule as the dedication required to get really good at something. However I don't take the full meaning to heart just the prior overall concept.

### Wave Based Growth

Growth in a skill comes in waves and this is something that the 10,000 rule misses in my humble opinion.

I have been good at a lot of different things:

- Basketball
- Rollerblading
- Scuba Diving
- Cycling
- Computer Games
- Guitar
- Judo (Martial Arts)

So I feel confident speaking to this.

Lets take the guitar example of earlier:

> Year 2 I got my first electric guitar
>
> Year 7 I was playing in two different bands able to play a fair amount of classic rock songs
>
> Year 12 My friend introduced me to the band Rush
>
> Year 14 Developed my own music tastes that pushed me to a new level of guitar playing. Bands including the likes of Periphery and Pantera that pushed my technical ability.
>
> Year 18 Finally sorted out my poor picking technique
>
> Year 20 Two years of skill maintenance. Neither improving nor regressing

Hopefully the missing years in this overview shows there are flat lines in my progress as a player.

> Changing my picking technique made me a worse player for 6 months before ultimately improving my playing.

Development comes in waves. The years where I started learning progressively harder riffs improved my playing over the years I didn't challenge myself with progressively harder songs.

## Sliding Scale

What is being good at something?

## Persistence and Challenges

Note: Persistence was also a factor in my growth as a guitar player. Practise went from 1 to 2 hours every few days to 4 hours a day for 2 years straight without missing a single day.

# Bounded Contexts

## Introduction

In Domain-Driven Development (DDD), a bounded context is a strategic pattern used to define a clear boundary around a specific subdomain within a larger, complex domain. It represents a distinct context or scope in which a specific model, language, and set of rules are applicable. Bounded contexts help manage the complexity of a domain by dividing it into smaller, more manageable parts.

## Concept

Here are some key aspects of bounded contexts in DDD:

### Encapsulation

A bounded context encapsulates a cohesive and self-contained area of the domain. It contains its own domain model, which includes entities, value objects, aggregates, and the associated business logic. The entities and concepts within a bounded context are meaningful and relevant within that specific context but may have different interpretations or representations in other bounded contexts.

### Ubiquitous Language

Each bounded context has its own ubiquitous language, which is a shared vocabulary between the domain experts and the development team. The language used within a bounded context is specific to that context and may differ from the language used in other contexts. This ensures clear and effective communication within the bounded context, promoting a shared understanding of the domain.

### Contextual Boundaries

Bounded contexts have explicit boundaries that define the limits of their applicability. These boundaries separate different aspects of the domain and establish clear isolation between different subdomains. The boundaries help manage complexity and prevent unnecessary dependencies between different parts of the domain.

### Context Mapping

When multiple bounded contexts interact with each other, a context mapping technique is used to establish relationships and define how information is shared between the contexts. Context mapping helps manage the integration and communication between bounded contexts while respecting their boundaries and autonomy.

### Strategic Design

Bounded contexts play a crucial role in strategic design decisions within DDD. They guide decisions related to the organization of the domain, the architecture of the software system, and the allocation of responsibilities and teams. Each bounded context may have its own technology stack, data storage, and implementation details, allowing teams to optimize their solutions within their specific context.

### Autonomous Development

Bounded contexts promote autonomous development within a larger system. Different teams can focus on their assigned bounded context, working independently within their context's boundaries. This allows teams to make decisions and evolve their bounded context's model and implementation without unnecessary coordination or interference.

## Conclusion

By defining bounded contexts, DDD allows for a better understanding and management of complex domains. It enables teams to tackle the domain in smaller, more focused areas, fostering clearer communication, encapsulated models, and independent development. Bounded contexts help ensure that the software system accurately represents the intricacies and requirements of different parts of the domain, leading to more maintainable and domain-driven solutions.

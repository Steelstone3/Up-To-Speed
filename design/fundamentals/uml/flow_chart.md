# Flow Chart

## Introduction

Flowcharts are commonly used in software development to represent the flow of a program or process, particularly when dealing with conditional statements. Flowcharts are often used to represent the various paths a program can take based on different conditions.

## Example

The flowchart would begin with a decision point, represented by a diamond symbol, which would have two or more possible outcomes, depending on the condition being evaluated. Each outcome would be represented by an arrow leading to a new decision point or a process step.

The process steps in the flowchart would represent the various actions the program would take depending on the outcome of the conditional statement. This could include assigning values to variables, calling functions, or other programmatic tasks.

## Side Note

Flow charts are not a type of UML diagram!

There is no such thing as a "UML flow chart" because flow charts and UML diagrams are two different types of diagrams.

Flow charts are used to represent the flow of a process, such as the steps in a decision-making process or a business workflow. They use a variety of shapes and symbols to represent different types of actions and decision points, and arrows to represent the flow of the process.

UML diagrams, on the other hand, are used to represent different aspects of software systems, such as their structure, behavior, and interactions. They use a standardized set of symbols and notations to represent objects, classes, relationships, and other concepts in the software system.

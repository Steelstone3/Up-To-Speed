# Messages As Contracts

## Introduction

In interaction-driven design, messages serve as contracts between objects participating in the system's interactions. Messages define the expectations, responsibilities, and communication protocols between objects, ensuring consistent and well-defined interactions. This concept is derived from the principles of message-driven architectures and emphasizes clear communication and collaboration between components.

## Concepts

Here are key aspects of messages as contracts in interaction-driven design:

### Defined Communication

Messages define the means of communication between objects. They encapsulate the information or commands exchanged between objects to trigger actions or request information. Messages provide a clear and standardized way for objects to interact and communicate with each other.

### Contractual Obligations

Messages act as contractual agreements between the sender and receiver objects. When an object sends a message to another object, it expects a specific response or behavior in return. The message contract specifies the expected format, parameters, and semantics of the message, ensuring that both sender and receiver adhere to the agreed-upon contract.

### Clear Responsibilities

Messages define the responsibilities of objects participating in the interaction. The sender communicates its intent or request through the message, while the receiver understands and responds to the message accordingly. By adhering to the message contract, objects clearly define their roles and responsibilities in the system's behavior.

### Consistent Communication Protocols

Messages establish consistent communication protocols between objects. They define how objects interact, including the order of message exchanges, the conditions for initiating or responding to messages, and any expected constraints or validations on the data exchanged. By following the message contracts, objects can establish reliable and predictable communication patterns.

### Encapsulation of Information

Messages encapsulate the relevant information required for the communication between objects. They carry data or parameters necessary to perform an action or provide context for the interaction. Messages can be simple, containing only primitive types or value objects, or complex, carrying rich domain-specific information.

### Evolving Contracts

Message contracts are not fixed and can evolve over time. As the system requirements or the understanding of the domain change, the contracts may be refined, expanded, or deprecated. This allows the system to adapt to new scenarios, accommodate changing needs, and support ongoing improvements.

## Conclusion

By treating messages as contracts, interaction-driven design promotes clear and unambiguous communication between objects. It establishes expectations, responsibilities, and protocols for interactions, enabling better collaboration between developers and domain experts. Messages as contracts facilitate the design and implementation of cohesive, loosely coupled, and maintainable systems by providing a common language for communication and coordination between objects.

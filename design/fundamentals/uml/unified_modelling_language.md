# Unified Modelling Language

## Introduction

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardised graphical language used for modeling software systems. It provides a set of visual tools and notations for representing different aspects of a software system, including its structure, behavior, and interactions.

## Types

UML includes a variety of diagrams, each designed to represent a specific aspect of the system. Some common UML diagrams include:

> - Class diagrams: Used to represent the structure of the system, including its classes, attributes, and relationships between them.
>
> - Use case diagrams: Used to represent the functionality or features of the system from the user's perspective.
>
> - Sequence diagrams: Used to represent the interactions between objects or components in the system over time.
>
> - State machine diagrams: Used to represent the behavior of an object or system in response to different events or stimuli.
>
> - Activity diagrams: Used to represent the flow of activities or processes within the system.

## Purpose

UML is widely used in software development as a tool for communicating design ideas and concepts, as well as for documenting software systems. It is a flexible and powerful language that allows developers to model systems at different levels of abstraction, from high-level architecture to low-level implementation details.

UML is also supported by a wide range of software development tools and frameworks, making it easy to create, modify, and share UML diagrams throughout the software development lifecycle.

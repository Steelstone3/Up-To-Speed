# Motivation

## Motivation in Minecraft

Yeah weird start to a blog about motivation I know but give me a chance. Minecraft to me a fascinating game on a psychological level to me. Unlike other games Minecraft is what is known as a sandbox game. This means there is no clear objective on what to do.

### A Typical Game of Minecraft

A typical game of minecraft for me looks like the following:

- Setup a server, port forward, setup keep inventory, no phantoms and no mob griefing rules
- Invite my friends
- Build a starter base
- Help others make a starter base
- Make a basic carrot/ potato/ wheat/ beetroot farm
- Find a nearby village
- Create an iron farm
- Get iron armour and tools
- Create a trader hall
- Get diamond armour
- Go to the nether to collect parts for redstone
- Create a pumpkin farm
- Collect the most amount of emeralds on the server
- Defeat the ender dragon
- etc

To be clear this is a typical game of minecraft that **I play**. Your game-play experience will likely look completely different which we will get into next.

### Gathering Iron

Getting into an example then in minecraft, to my knowledge of the game at least, there are two main ways of collecting iron.

- Mine iron
- Kill iron golems

However within these two main ways are options. As I alluded to earlier an iron farm exploits game mechanics for generating iron golems and murders said golems in lava collecting the iron they drop on death.

However there is nothing stopping you wondering into a village in the early game with a wooden sword and taking the iron from the iron golems by force. After all the same mechanic will re-spawn the iron golem as in the contraption.

Another way of collecting iron is through mining it. Often players create a mineshaft at a particular "Y-Level" (in game world depth) to exploit the most prominent natural spawning of iron blocks at that level.

However, again there is nothing stopping you exploring a cave to find iron naturally or even climbing mountains to find it up there.

So this starts to get towards the core of motivation.

> In order to progress in the game "I want iron armour" in order to get iron armour I need to do one or more of the above. Getting iron armour provides me more protection for doing more dangerous tasks in the game...

This covers how motivation for doing things starts to form let us try to understand it further.

## Types of Motivation

### Extrinsic Motivation

Extrinsic motivation is the external driving factor in motivation. If we take the example of earlier getting iron armour is the extrinsic motivation.

Applied to a work setting this is the "get x done by y" that you'll hear all to often.

Extrinsic motivations aren't very motivating to people often they boil down to tasks that have to get done often at little material benefit to the individual.

So it stands to reason we need something else.

### Intrinsic Motivation

Intrinsic motivation is the internal narrative we tell ourselves for completing the extrinsic motivation.

Intrinsic motivation need not be complex and can often scale with the task at hand.

The reason for tidying the house can be as simple as being house proud or it being ready for guests you have yet to invite over.

Framing a task or issue in a different intrinsically motivated light can lead to more positive outcomes

From:

> "I don't want to tidy the house".

To:

> "If I tidy the house then it will be ready for guests. If it is ready for guests then I can invite them over. If I invite guests over I can be social. When I am socialising I am happy.

Ok that last one might be a stretch for some

So this leads us to a line of thinking in the work setting

> "Do X by Y"

Now requires of us the need to think of a better intrinsic motivation than

> Get the work done because I was told to by my boss

Which is the equivalent of

> Tidy the house because it is untidy

### Discipline

"If I am disciplined I can do anything regardless of if I am interested in the task or not" is the lie we tell ourselves. How many times have you said that to yourself. "If I was just a bit more disciplined..."

Forget about discipline in this traditional framing. Instead start to think of discipline as emphasis of the intrinsic narrative on repeat.

## Conclusion

Motivation is complex and I haven't covered every facet however I hope to have armed you with the tools to maintain drive towards a goal whatever or however you got inspired towards it.

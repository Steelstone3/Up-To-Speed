# Code Confidence

## Introduction

Many development circles will insist on the idea of "test coverage". It is my belief that this creates the wrong approach to test driven development and therefore instead I aim for code confidence.

## Concept

To expand on this concept, if a change was to be made to the code how confident are we that the changes made aren't breaking changes.

With a high degree of confidence we can be near certain that a "green build" (one where all the tests pass) will have no breaking changes and vice versa.

## Best Practise

The best way to ensure "code confidence" is developing in a test driven way.

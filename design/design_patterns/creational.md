## Notes

### Singleton

Singleton is redacted here as it is considered an anti pattern.

### Prototype

Prototype pattern has two means of cloning:

Deep clone which creates a copy of the memory on the heap with its own pointer.

Shallow clone which creates a new reference (pointer) to the original memory on the heap.

It is important to know the differences in the two and how they will behave when used.

# Growth How To Improve

## Introduction

Just a short one but I think this is an important one. Failure really genuinely is a part of life and completely fine.

## Your Average

Hate to break it to you but you are average. It sounds worse than it actually is so give me a chance to explain myself.

Take a talent/ hobby or skill you have and start to digest where you would place if you were to compare yourself to everyone else that also has that talent, hobby or skill in an average-ness bell curve graph.

For myself I will take my guitar playing. I started in 2004. YouTube wasn't out at this time and guitar content on YouTube was even further out. The hardest song I can play well is Periphery Prayer Position and the hardest solo I can play well is Pantera Domination.

> The songs I have named are hard and require a lot practice, technique and patience to master

On the average-ness bell curve taking all guitar players I sit about upper-average. The music that inspires me from the 90s to the 10s is more technically challenging than the music from the 70s so that pushes me to be a more technical player (mastery by imitation). On the other hand I was too early to the train to have YouTube as my teacher which has a wider array of knowledge and expertise than what a single guitar teacher can provide.

There are some other considerations within this bell curve I have ignored in my personal ranking. 90% of people who take up an instrument quit within a year and 50% within 2 years. I have been playing for 20 years (2004) which will put me into a rare minority of players. Rarer still is the age I started. I have played in 3 different bands. I have music that I am writing right now.

When you consider all of these other factor that could be consider outliers where you sit on the average-ness curve looks better than it might have done at first.

> On average just being dedicated and sticking at something can find yourself landing around the top 10% with diminishing returns past that point

Being average is a super power and I will speak more to this later in this blog.

## Growth

### Thousand Hours Rule

The thousand hours rule to get good at something is a myth. This gets extrapolated to ten-thousand hours to be the best which exacerbates the myth and leads to people burning out when they don't see the results they want to see as they try to improve.

> 1,000 hours is 41 days
>
> 10,000 hours is 416 days

I like to think of the myth of the 10,000 hours rule as the dedication required to get really good at something. However I don't take the full meaning to heart just the prior overall concept.

### Wave Based Growth

Growth in a skill comes in waves and this is something that the 10,000 rule misses in my humble opinion.

I have been good at a lot of different things:

- Basketball
- Rollerblading
- Scuba Diving
- Cycling
- Computer Games
- Guitar
- Judo (Martial Arts)

So I feel confident speaking to this.

Lets take the guitar example of earlier:

> Year 2 I got my first electric guitar
>
> Year 7 I was playing in two different bands able to play a fair amount of classic rock songs
>
> Year 12 My friend introduced me to the band Rush
>
> Year 14 Developed my own music tastes that pushed me to a new level of guitar playing. Bands including the likes of Periphery and Pantera that pushed my technical ability.
>
> Year 18 Finally sorted out my poor picking technique
>
> Year 20 Two years of skill maintenance. Neither improving nor regressing

Hopefully the missing years in this overview shows there are flat lines in my progress as a player.

> Changing my picking technique made me a worse player for 6 months before ultimately improving my playing.

Development comes in waves. The years where I started learning progressively harder riffs improved my playing over the years I didn't challenge myself with progressively harder songs.

## Sliding Scale

Quantifying how good you are at something through time is interesting in and of itself. For many industries what makes for someone being talented or good evolves.

> Yes -> Rush -> Dream Theatre -> Periphery

Is a direct example with each band sighting the previous as a form of inspiration in the progressive rock/ metal scene. Each band is progressively building upon the previous in both complexity and technicality on the respective instruments.

However this is one limited scope when it comes to growth, talent, ability and how good you are. Many other soft skills often come into any hobby or profession such as:

> - Being able to organise
> - Practice routines
> - Persistance
> - Motivation
> - Smiling through mistakes
> - Making connections
> - Marketing
> - Experience
> - The show
> - Time keeping
> - Flexibility
> - Practice

So on. This is why older bands remain relevant whilst newer bands come through and can even reinvent their role within the industry.

Another way of looking at my point is in three bands I have seen live in recent years Periphery, Pilini and Animals as Leaders are all bands I have seen live. In my view Animals as Leaders have more technical songs than Periphery and yet I found Animals as Leaders the best band out of the three live. The reason for this is they took their original songs and improvised around them in places which I found absolutely incredible considering their complexity. But this is personal preference and each band has something to offer to their audiences. All this to say each band has found a set of things that work from them in the list of traits listed above.

So what makes you good in a given industry or hobby has more to do with other things that you can bring to the table besides the main thing be it being part of a band, programming, scuba diving etc

## Persistence and Challenges

Persistence at a thing is the key to improvement. There is no other way to get better at something than to keep at it.

However it is important to remember the points from earlier that improvement comes in the form of waves. It is therefore important to take breaks but the breaks can't be too large or you'll also regress in ability.

### Ability

Ability will regress without persistance however ability remains quickly recoverable up to a certain period of time. After that ability is still able to be recovered and whilst slower than before it will still be faster than "from scratch".

It is important to keep up some form of daily routine as a baseline for any skill that you aim to be good at.

Keeping current is also a part of any level of a ability as alluded to earlier not keeping current with ability means you will fall behind. This is not to say however that it is important to keep up with every industry/ hobby trend or change more just to be aware of it taking place and be prepared, adaptable and ready enough to adopt new practices as they present themselves.

### Learning From Mistakes

Mistakes are something that we need to embrace more rather than shy away from, reject or feel overly guilty about. Being pragmatic to mistakes can lead to ways of working that avoid the pitfalls of future work.

Mistakes are made all the time and when they are consider the following:

> - How was the mistake made?
> - What was the impact?
> - How would I approach the same events in future?
> - Are there any key actions I could have taken differently?

Some form of self assessment like this one can help process the mistake made and work through it for better outcomes in future. It often helps to speak to a peer with more experience as they may have insight from making a similar mistake.

### Learning From Hurdles

Hurdles are things that we currently find challenging. There is usually lots to learn from hurdles and this can be fun.

Firstly and importantly try.

Without trying you won't know if this is a hurdle in your progression that you can overcome or not. Importantly when you come across a hurdle demotivation can set in. In such cases:

> "Do the thing with a little push that you wouldn't want to do without"

For example this might be to go to a club/ activity you were indecisive about. Applying the phrase would lead you to try it, see if you like it and return in such cases. This is something you may not have done sat in indecisive thought.

The phrase also doesn't exert too much pressure which can be paralyzing in and of itself.

Now that we are trying the important thing from here is to do our best with our current skill level.

If we have made our best attempt and still haven't conquered the hurdle; it may be time to seek guidance from someone more experienced who can provide insight.

> Take this opportunity to learn the processes, approach and techniques they apply to the hurdle as they are as important as conquering the hurdle itself for future hurdles you'll encounter

When a hurdle is conquered take time to reflect on the challenge presented

> - What was it about the hurdle that was so challenging?
> - How did I overcome it?
> - In what way did my mentor assist me?

and so on...

## Taking Stock

It is also important to take pride in achievements, milestones and overcoming hurdles. It is all well and good improving to get better but time should be taken to consider your current place, accomplishments, achievements and progress

> "Take time to look at the view on the mountain you have climbed"

Without doing this you'll get demotivated and feel down in how much further there still is to go and this attitude is ultimately defeatist and misses the point that getting to the top of the top is incredibly difficult and improbable for most.

## Conclusion and Takeaways

Growth in anything is a motivation game and whilst most of us are average we should take pride in that especially a unique skill where most didn't have the staying power.

Its really important to not get stressed out or put too much pressure on yourself as everyone grows at different rates and at different "waves".

And I think most important of all take pride in what you have currently achieved in any skill you are assessing your progress with. Look down that metaphoric mountain of continuous, persistent progress and think back to a time where there was still so far to go and compare to now to find that renewed sense of motivation for the next phase so you can do the same again in 2 - 5 years.

# Non-Relational Database Types

## Introduction

There are several types of non-relational databases

## Key-Value Stores

These databases store data as a collection of key-value pairs. They are simple and highly scalable, making them suitable for caching, session management, and distributed systems.

### Document Databases

Document databases store data in flexible, self-describing documents (e.g., JSON or XML). They allow hierarchical structures and nested data, making them suitable for applications with complex and evolving data schemas.

### Columnar Databases

Columnar databases store data in columns rather than rows, enabling efficient retrieval of specific columns. They are optimized for analytical workloads that involve aggregations and complex queries.

### Graph Databases

Graph databases store data in nodes and edges, representing entities and relationships. They excel at traversing complex relationships and are commonly used in applications involving social networks, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.

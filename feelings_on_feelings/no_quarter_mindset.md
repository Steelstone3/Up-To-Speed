# No Quarter Mindset

Warning hot takes ahead!

## Companies and Employment

Before we start down a rabbit hole of hot takes from my working experience I think it is important we take the time to address the concept of employment.

> Employment is an agreed contract between employer and employee by the means of which work will get done for the employer

Keep this concept in mind as we move forward in this blog.

## Where It Goes Wrong

How many times in your working history have you "been sold a lie". The first few weeks of settling in and meeting the team start out great then all of a sudden your expectations are shattered with the reality of your new workplace.

This has happened to me twice. So it would seem this is an important one to understand how this happens.

### Company 1

Company 1 offered an internship program for progression within the scuba diving industry in both commercial work and recreational teaching. Students would be giving bed and board along with their training for free in exchange for work.

The job involved 56 hour work weeks, I had no further qualifications to my name in 3 months. Every success and mistake was scrutinized leading to a blame culture and even worse mistakes being made than necessary from paralytic decision making.

Needless to say I left.

### Company 2

Company 2 offered growth opportunities for software engineers who valued correct processes, standards and modern practices.

The job involved a 40 hour work week plus copious amounts of "optional" personal development time (+20 hours). This in an effort to make yourself marketable to the internal job market when you inevitably get "benched" (a consultancy term for not on a team).

Some team leaders were protected from creating toxic team working environments due to "getting the results".

Internal training had spaces where a toxic elitist atmosphere could thrive preventing junior developers stepping up to present their ideas to the internal community of practice stifling growth opportunities.

A perfect case of a company's ideals being twisted against them.

### People Over Processes

Work is not a place of freedom it is a place of servitude. The best companies can give is an illusion of freedom with approaches such as "movie vouchers, pizza on Friday, free gym membership", flexible working and work from home.

All work is monitored in some way. This is just a part of business and not something software developers like to focus on or overly think about from my experience.

Good companies entrust their employees to "do your job" with an enclosed team focused monitoring approach such as agile. Key stakeholders are kept in the loop with product demonstrations, customer feedback and so on to end up with a software product all parties are happy with (in theory).

These same companies will have a healthy relationship with team failure in no-blame cultures and will seek solutions, processes and feedback from team members rather than enforcing stricter means of monitoring and control.

Bad companies, typically in industries with higher monetary pressure or instability, treat their employees like untrustworthy children installing monitoring software and have gross levels of upper management oversight and bureaucracy.

When failures and mistakes happen at these companies more control/ monitoring is put in place to ensure the work gets done. Things like flexible working and working from home are the first things to go and mandatory overtime one of the last things to come in for the complete bonanza of a toxic workplace.

This is what is known as a sliding scale...

### Sliding Scale

Sliding scale is the process whereby a workplace becomes worse/ toxic over time.

The best way to conceptualize this is to consider a company in generations.

#### Example

For example a company called "Sahara" who specialize in creating e-commerce websites for clients

**Generation 1:** are given flexible working, work from home, free gym membership and no mandatory overtime

> Sahara's management finds that it can't manage remote employees effectively so after a review has decided that some meetings will be held in the office and remote tracking software will be required on employee laptops.
>
> Derek is a big privacy advocate and for him the tracking software crosses a line so he leaves

**Generation 2:** now has flexible working, hybrid working, tracking software, free gym membership, no mandatory overtime

> Sahara's upper management think that some employees are not pulling there weight due to the flexible working arrangement and have decided to make this policy more restrictive along with mandating three days a week in the office for closer monitoring of employee activity.
>
> Sarah has children she needs to take to school each morning and as a single parent this policy change makes her life needlessly difficult so she leaves

**Generation 3:** now has restricted working hours, mostly office working, tracking software, free gym membership, no mandatory overtime

> Sahara now has a rush of clients so overtime is now required by all members of staff

*Did you enjoy your free gym membership?*

#### Explanation

Because "Sahara" sees the failings of upper management or external market forces and has no scope for adaptation/ refection of its processes and so on it becomes the employee's fault. As a result the working environment becomes worse.

With each generation multiple members of staff will leave the company. This can be known as a "vote with your feet" move to the individual but plays a larger role in the accepted "company culture" (what people are prepared to put up with).

The ones that remain now accept the new working arrangement. Employees have very little say on this fact outside of legislation and unions which are ran by committee covering broad standards and not designed for meeting individualistic needs.

#### Business Darwinism Fallacy

Sliding scale is the process by which companies evolve to survive in a way you could see it as "business based natural selection" only this is false as you'll come to understand.

Company culture is determined by the force that is the sliding scale however negative company culture has only marginally effects a toxic company's bottom line. The evidence exists all around us.

Positive company culture can have a huge impact on the company's performance as it unlocks creativity in individuals who can then innovate which inturn attracts top talent to the company. However these efforts take time and effort to implement meaning no immediate results are seen for a while.

Companies with tight deadlines and external pressures don't have "a while" to see results and the sliding scale starts.

## The "No Quarter" Mindset

> Give an inch and they will take a mile

It is with the understanding of the above flaws of companies that I present the "No Quarter" mindset.

This individualist and brutal approach can save you from some of the pitfalls above.

### Being A Generalist

In order to survive as a famous surviver once said you must "Adapt and Overcome". Generalist is a term for a core set of skills software developers need so they can be flexible in their career decisions. I can't provide a definitive list as technologies are forever changing.

Core concepts however can apply here if you have learnt one javascript framework, game engine etc you can learn another. Don't waste time chasing technological "white rabbits" especially if other areas of your "generalist approach" aren't up to scratch.

Search for roles that you would consider applying for; see the technology and skills they require then go about learning the frameworks that are of interest to you.

The end result of this step should be a good broad base that doesn't pigeon hold you into one part of the software industry.

### "Change The Culture"

Changing company culture is a painful waste of time. See the sliding scale to see just how futile your efforts will be in 5 - 10 years from when you leave.

Save your energy, find a company that suits you and move on when it no longer does.

### Growth, Impact, Reward, Work Life Balance

Taken from [Thriving Technologist](<https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyDev/>) I like this model for choosing your next career move wisely. However I would like to expand this model further.

> - Growth is a company providing you the environment to share ideas, be creative, make mistakes and have less pressure put on the individual from a no-blame culture
> - Impact is your ability to provide impact to the working practices, methodologies or a large important chunk of work to a company
> - Reward is both your pay packet, perks and pension for the role at a company
> - Work life balance is the amount of servitude you are prepared to put up with

Good companies can offer all of the above, Bad companies can barely offer 1

Let me explain

Good companies at any point in your career can provide opportunities to grow with flexible working arrangements, reasonable reward for the work you do and opportunities to make large contributions for your respective role

Bad companies with toxic workplace environments can't. Growth will be stagnant, impact will be negligible or fearful of consequence, reward could be high but that doesn't mean a lot when you can't enjoy any of it and work life balance will be no existent to meet the deadline or some self/ company set growth criteria.

The model proposed by Thriving Technologist is a good one when thought about in a more complex way. Whilst you might target specific things within this model a good company can provide everything you require in a suitable working environment that fits your needs.

### Probe The Company

When you are looking for a job move consider the sliding scale

Find out what the company is or was like on sites such as [Glass Door](<https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/index.htm>)

Interview the interviewers. You can!

> - Can you provide me some examples about how the company has adapted its working practices since the pandemic?
> - Can you provide an example in where you have adapted working practices to fit the needs of a diverse (insert your need/s here) employee?

and so on. In the interview stage you have a surprising amount of power to negotiate terms of employment, pay and other working arrangements.

If they get broken see the next step...

### Be Prepared To Vote With Your Feet

Going back to the discussion on the "sliding scale" above you want to be principled in what crosses your line.

Don't accept mandatory overtime, long travel times to the office, un-compensated travel and hotel costs for "free pizza fridays and gym membership" the latter of which you don't use.

Be principled, stand up for yourself and employ malicious compliance where necessary.

If they say go to the office 3 times a week and your employee contract says "work from home" guess what you are doing. When HR gets involved toe the line until they are not. Keep doing your work to make it an unfair dismissal case.

If the company doesn't capitulate then it is their loss when you leave to the next role. You don't and never did have to take it because we are in demand as software developers.

When your lines are crossed start making plans to move.

### Finding Peace At Work

Finding a company that truly respects the ways in which you like to work and can truly accommodate those needs is a good one. This job you should keep for as long as you can.

At some point your needs may change in the employer/ employee contract at which point you should amicably split as your needs may cycle back round to alignment with what this company can offer at some point in the future.

## Conclusion

Remember I said to keep this statement in mind

> Employment is an agreed contract between employer and employee by the means of which work will get done for the employer

Unfortunately this agreement rarely stays static and usually gets worse.

It is important to protect ourselves (and deal some damage am I right Skyrim fans!) with a no quarter mindset when taking on a new role to ensure we get the best deal for ourselves going into a role.

It is also important to be ruthless in how we negotiate going into a role, re-negotiate terms and find ways to make the working environment work for us.

We should also be prepared to leave when the agreed terms of the role are corrupted over time.

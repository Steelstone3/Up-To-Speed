# Refactoring Legacy Code

## Definition

Before refactoring legacy code... *how can legacy code be defined?*

Legacy Code: Legacy code is untested code where change can't be measured.

*Why is legacy code untested code?*

Legacy code is code that we fear to change. Tests provide confidence in the changes made to code aren't breaking. Without tests, changes to code lack confidence meaning developers are less likely to change code. This in turn leads to neglected code that becomes legacy over time as developers leave projects and authors of the code forget how it worked (especially in more complex systems).

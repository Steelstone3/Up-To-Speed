# Datatypes

## Introduction

C# is a strongly typed language, which means that all variables must have a specific type assigned to them. C# provides a range of built-in data types that developers can use to declare and manipulate variables.

## Primative Types

Type | Represents | Range | Default Value
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
bool | Boolean value | True or False | False

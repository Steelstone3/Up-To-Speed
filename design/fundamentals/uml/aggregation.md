# Aggregate

An aggregate can be seen as "loosely coupled". It is to put related systems together (through aggregation) whilst keeping them as separate concepts.

For example a Chimpanzee is a animal that can live in a location where that location the chimpanzee is assosiated could be a zoo or it could be the jungle.

The key point here is both the Zoo and Chimpanzee can exist together or separately and can therefore be described as an aggregate relationship.

## Aggregate > Components

- A zoo with animals (context matters)

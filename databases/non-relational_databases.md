# Non Relational Databases

## Introduction

Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, are a type of database management system that provides an alternative to traditional relational databases. Unlike relational databases, which organize data in tables with predefined schemas and enforce strict data integrity rules, non-relational databases offer more flexible and scalable data models.

## Concepts

Here are some key characteristics and types of non-relational databases:

### Schema flexibility

Non-relational databases do not enforce a fixed schema. They allow for dynamic and flexible data models, enabling the storage of varying data structures within the same database. This flexibility is particularly useful when dealing with unstructured or semi-structured data.

### Scalability and Performance

Non-relational databases are designed to scale horizontally, meaning they can distribute data across multiple servers or clusters. This architecture allows them to handle large amounts of data and provide high-performance data access and processing. Non-relational databases are often used in scenarios with massive data volumes and high read/write loads.

### Variety of Data Models

Non-relational databases support various data models, including key-value stores, document databases, columnar databases, and graph databases.

### High Availability and Fault Tolerance

Non-relational databases often provide built-in mechanisms for data replication, automatic failover, and distributed data storage. These features ensure high availability and fault tolerance, making them suitable for applications that require continuous uptime and resilience.

### Optimized for Distributed Environments

Non-relational databases are designed to operate in distributed environments, making them well-suited for cloud computing and distributed computing architectures. They can span across multiple data centers or regions, enabling geographic scalability and data replication.

### No Transactional Support

In many cases, non-relational databases sacrifice transactional support in favor of scalability and performance. While some non-relational databases offer limited transactional capabilities, they generally do not provide the same level of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees as relational databases.

## Conclusion

Non-relational databases are commonly used in a wide range of applications, including web applications, real-time analytics, content management systems, Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, and big data processing. They provide flexibility, scalability, and performance advantages in scenarios where traditional relational databases may face limitations due to rigid schemas, scalability challenges, or high data volume requirements.

# Component

Components meanwhile is to describe a "tightly coupled". It to put codependent systems together keeping them as a combined concept.

A good example of this can be seen in a computer. A computer runs as a sum of all of its parts and doesn't work properly if any one of those parts is faulty or missing.

For example a computer without RAM would have no fast access storage for running high demand modern programs and would likely crash.

Within this example we can see the strength and weakness of this concept... it is tightly coupled. This is to say if a single part of the whole was to go wrong the whole thing would collapse. This is why it is wise to be selective about when you apply this approach.

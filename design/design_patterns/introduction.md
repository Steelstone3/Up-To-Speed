# Design Patterns

## Introduction

Design patterns in coding are reusable solutions to common software development problems. They provide a way to solve problems that have been encountered before and have proven to be effective.

## Types

Design patterns are split into three distinct groups:

### Creational Patterns

These patterns are used to create objects and manage their creation. Examples include the Singleton pattern, Factory pattern, and Builder pattern.

### Structural patterns

These patterns are used to organize code components into larger structures. Examples include the Adapter pattern, Bridge pattern, and Decorator pattern.

### Behavioral patterns

These patterns are used to manage communication between objects and how they interact with each other. Examples include the Observer pattern, Chain of Responsibility pattern, and Strategy pattern.

## Usage

Design patterns provide developers with a common vocabulary and a way to communicate and share solutions to common problems. They help developers to create code that is reusable, flexible, and easy to maintain. They also prevent "reinventing the wheel" in many software issues that are encountered.

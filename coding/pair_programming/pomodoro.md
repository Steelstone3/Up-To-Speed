# Pomodoro Pair Programming Style

Pomodoro pair programming style combines the principles of the Pomodoro Technique with pair programming. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses timed intervals to structure work and breaks. When applied to pair programming, it introduces dedicated time blocks for focused work and collaboration, alternating with short breaks.

## Process

Here's how it works:

### Set a Pomodoro timer

The Pomodoro timer is typically set to a specific interval, commonly 25 minutes, known as a "Pomodoro." This interval represents a dedicated period for focused work.

### Choose roles

In the context of pair programming, the two individuals decide on their rolesâ€”typically a driver and a navigator. The driver writes the code, while the navigator provides feedback and guidance.

### Start the timer and work

Once the Pomodoro timer begins, the pair starts working together. The driver takes control of the keyboard and actively writes the code, while the navigator actively observes, reviews, suggests improvements, and guides the driver as needed.

### Collaborate and communicate

Throughout the Pomodoro interval, the pair engages in continuous collaboration, discussing ideas, problem-solving, and ensuring code quality. The navigator can share insights, ask clarifying questions, and provide input to enhance the code being written.

### Complete the Pomodoro

Once the Pomodoro interval is over (e.g., after 25 minutes), both individuals stop working and take a short break.

### Reflect and switch roles

During the break, the pair reflects on the work accomplished and discusses potential improvements. They can also switch roles, allowing the previous navigator to become the driver and vice versa.

### Repeat the cycle

The pair continues working in subsequent Pomodoros, following the same pattern of focused work, short breaks, and role switching. Typically, after a few Pomodoros (e.g., four), a more extended break of 15-30 minutes is taken to recharge and rest.

## Conclusion

The Pomodoro pair programming style can be an effective way to manage time, maintain focus, and foster collaboration in a pair programming setting. It combines the benefits of both the Pomodoro Technique and pair programming, resulting in improved productivity and code quality.

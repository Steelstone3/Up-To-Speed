# Test Doubles

## Introduction

Test doubles are objects or code constructs that are used in software testing to simulate the behavior of real objects or dependencies that a tested object interacts with.

## Types

There are several types of test doubles, including mocks, stubs, fakes, and dummies.

> - Mocks are objects that record the interactions between the tested object and its dependencies, allowing for the verification of the tested object's behavior.
>
> - Stubs provide a predetermined response to a method or function call, allowing for the testing of the tested object's behavior when it interacts with a particular dependency.
>
> - Fakes are simpler implementations of a dependency that provide a similar behavior to the real implementation, but with less complexity or faster performance.
>
> - Dummies are objects that are passed as arguments but are not actually used in the test, allowing for the testing of the tested object's behavior when it interacts with a particular number of dependencies.

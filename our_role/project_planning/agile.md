# Agile

## Introduction

Agile development is an iterative and collaborative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, adaptability, and customer satisfaction. It contrasts with traditional waterfall development, which follows a linear and sequential process.

## Principles

In agile development, the software is built incrementally in short iterations called sprints, typically lasting two to four weeks. Each sprint focuses on delivering a working piece of software that provides value to the customer. The development team collaborates closely with stakeholders, including customers and end-users, throughout the process.

The core principles of agile development, as outlined in the Agile Manifesto, include:

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Agile places a strong emphasis on communication, collaboration, and teamwork. It values interactions among team members and with customers over rigid processes or reliance on tools.

### Working software over comprehensive documentation

Agile prioritizes delivering functional software that meets customer needs rather than extensive documentation. While documentation is important, it should be concise and focused on essential information.

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Agile promotes close collaboration with customers to understand their requirements, gather feedback, and make adjustments throughout the development process. This ensures that the final product meets the customer's expectations.

### Responding to change over following a plan

Agile recognizes that requirements and priorities can change over time. It embraces change and allows for flexibility in adapting to new information or customer feedback, rather than rigidly adhering to an initial plan.

## Importance

Agile development methodologies, such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP), provide specific frameworks and practices to implement these principles. These methodologies often include daily stand-up meetings, backlog management, user stories, sprint planning, and retrospective meetings to continuously improve the development process.

## Conclusion

By adopting agile practices, development teams can increase their ability to respond to change, deliver higher-quality software, improve collaboration, and achieve greater customer satisfaction.

# Interaction Driven Development

## Introduction

Interaction-driven design, also known as Interaction-Driven Development (IDD), is an approach within Domain-Driven Development (DDD) that emphasizes the design and development of software systems based on the interactions between the system's components and actors. It focuses on modeling and designing the behavior and collaboration of objects, with a primary emphasis on the messages exchanged between them.

## Concepts

Key aspects of interaction-driven design in DDD include:

> * Use Case or Feature-Centric Approach
>
> * Designing Collaborating Objects
>
> * Messages as Contracts
>
> * Collaborative Design Sessions
>
> * Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Integration
>
> * Iterative Refinement

## Conclusion

The goal of interaction-driven design is to capture the essence of the system's behavior and collaboration by focusing on the messages exchanged between objects. It promotes clear communication, collaboration, and understanding between developers and domain experts. By emphasizing the interactions, interaction-driven design aims to build software systems that effectively fulfill the identified use cases and meet the needs of the stakeholders.

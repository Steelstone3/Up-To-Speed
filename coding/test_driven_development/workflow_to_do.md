# The Workflow

## Introduction

Test driven development can be seen as a workflow. It allows for a fast yet accurate means of creating software through the process of red, green, refactor.

## Red, Green, Refactor

Red → Green → Refactor ⏎

> Red: Write a failing test. This should be the only failing test.
>
> Green: Make the test pass with the simplest implementation.
>
> Refactor: Consider any refactors that can done to both implementation and tests whilst keeping all tests green.
>
> Repeat

It is important when following the process to start with a simple test and implementation then increase the complexity by extending both the test and implementation.

## Best Practise

- Practise katas in order to form habits around the RGR workflow and ensures the test driven process is followed.
- Ensure that the refactoring step is followed after each pass of the loop.
- Ensure that there is only 1 failing test.
- Ensure the simplest implementation is written in order to make the test pass.

## Example

NOTE: WRITE A TEST, WRITE THE SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATION, REFACTOR

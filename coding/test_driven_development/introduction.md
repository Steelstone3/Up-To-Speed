# Introduction To Test Driven Development

## Introduction

*Why test driven development?*

To answer this defining software is essential for understanding what test driven development seeks to achieve. Software is divided into two words soft and ware. Ware refers to the type of logical system. The soft part of the word means to be able to change. Hard meanwhile means unchanging. Therefore, software means a changing logical system and hardware means an unchanging logical system.

Software that is unable or hard to change by definition is hardware and software without tests is hard to change.

Test driven development allows for software to remain soft as it provides confidence for code changes to developers in treating tests as first party citizens of the codebase.

# Ping Pong Pair Programming Style

## Introduction

Ping pong-style pair programming is a variation of pair programming that involves a back-and-forth interaction between two developers, often referred to as the driver and the navigator. The name "ping pong" reflects the idea of bouncing the work between the two individuals, much like a ping pong ball.

## Process

In ping pong pair programming, the process typically follows these steps:

### The driver starts by writing a test

The driver, responsible for writing the code, begins by creating a test for the desired functionality. The driver's focus is on the test's implementation rather than the actual solution.

### The navigator reviews the test and writes the implementation

Once the driver finishes writing the test, they pass the control to the navigator. The navigator examines the test and then writes the minimal code required to make the test pass. The navigator's focus is on writing the simplest code that satisfies the test.

### The roles switch

After the navigator writes the implementation, they pass control back to the driver. The driver now examines the code written by the navigator, refactors if necessary, and writes the next test for additional functionality or behavior.

### Repeat the cycle

The process continues with the roles switching back and forth between the driver and the navigator. Each iteration involves writing a test by one person and implementing the code to pass the test by the other person.

## Conclusion

Ping pong pair programming can be particularly effective for small, focused tasks or for tackling complex problems that benefit from the synergy of two minds. It fosters collaboration, shared understanding, and continuous improvement throughout the development process.

# Refactoring

## Introduction

Refactoring code is the process of improving the structure, design, and readability of existing code without changing its external behavior. It involves making modifications to the code to enhance its maintainability, extensibility, and efficiency, while preserving the functionality and correctness of the software.

## Goal

The primary goal of refactoring is to eliminate code smells, which are indicators of poor design or implementation choices that can lead to difficulties in understanding, modifying, and debugging code. By refactoring, developers can make the code easier to comprehend, reduce duplication, enhance modularity, and improve overall code quality.

## Examples

Some common refactorings include:

> * Extract Method: Breaking down a large function into smaller, more focused methods to improve readability and reusability.
>
> * Rename: Giving more meaningful names to variables, functions, and classes, which enhances the understanding of their purpose and improves code documentation.
>
> * Remove Duplication: Identifying and eliminating redundant code to reduce the chance of errors and make maintenance easier.
>
> * Extract Class: Creating a new class to encapsulate related behavior and data from an existing class, promoting better organization and separation of concerns.
>
> * Replace Conditional Logic with Polymorphism: Replacing long chains of if-else or switch statements with a more object-oriented approach, utilizing inheritance and polymorphism for improved flexibility and extensibility.
>
> * Simplify Expressions: Refactoring complex expressions or statements into simpler forms that are easier to understand and maintain.
>
> * Improve Data Structures: Reorganizing data structures, such as using dictionaries or maps instead of parallel arrays, to enhance efficiency and readability.

## Best Practises

Refactoring should be done incrementally, ensuring that the code remains functional at each step. Automated tests are crucial for refactoring, as they help detect potential regressions and provide confidence that the code still functions correctly after modifications.

# DRY

## Introduction

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a principle in software development that emphasizes the avoidance of code duplication. The goal of writing DRY code is to eliminate redundancy and promote reusability, maintainability, and overall code quality.

## Issues Of WET Code

When code is duplicated in multiple places, it creates several issues:

> * Maintenance difficulties: Duplicated code requires making changes in multiple locations, which increases the chances of introducing bugs or inconsistencies. It also makes it harder to understand and update the code in the future.
>
> * Increased development time: Writing and maintaining duplicate code takes more time and effort than writing it once and reusing it in multiple places. DRY code helps improve productivity by reducing unnecessary repetition.
>
> * Inconsistencies and errors: Duplication can lead to inconsistencies, as changes made in one place may be forgotten or overlooked in other duplicate sections. This can introduce bugs and make the codebase more error-prone.

## Applying DRY Code Principle

To achieve DRY code, several techniques can be employed:

> * Extract reusable code: Identify duplicated code and extract it into a separate function, method, or module. This way, the code can be reused by multiple parts of the program, reducing redundancy.
>
> * Utilize functions and libraries: Leverage existing functions and libraries instead of rewriting similar functionality. Reusable functions and libraries are often optimized, tested, and maintained, providing more reliable and efficient solutions.
>
> * Parameterise behavior: Instead of duplicating code with minor variations, use parameters or configuration options to modify the behavior of a function or module. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.
>
> * Use inheritance and polymorphism: Object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance and polymorphism allow for code reuse by creating reusable classes and hierarchies. Common behavior can be placed in a superclass, while subclasses can override or extend specific functionality as needed.
>
> * Apply design patterns: Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common programming problems. By following established patterns, developers can avoid reinventing the wheel and write more maintainable and reusable code.

## Conclussion

Writing DRY code improves code maintainability, reduces the likelihood of bugs, and increases developer productivity. It encourages modular, reusable, and well-structured code, making it easier to understand, modify, and extend the software over time.
